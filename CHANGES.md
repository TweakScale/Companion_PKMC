# TweakScale Companion :: Near Future Add'Ons :: Changes

* 2020-0927: 0.0.4.0 (Lisias) for KSP >= 1.3
	+ Another batch of patch revisions
		- Added missing Scale Exponents
		- Revised and fixed Cleaning Ups
		- Some parts had the scaling revised
	+ Added Show Stopper when using TweakScale 2.4.3.x or older
		- Only TweakScale 2.4.4 can overcome KSP "automatic updating" scheme that rendered TweakScale automatic Scaling fixes useless.
		- New Savegames are ok to go, but ongoing Savegames will risk corruption unless you use TweakScale 2.4.4. or newer!
	+ Since the patches are tied to NF Add'Ons and TweakScale, it's possible to be installed down to KSP 1.3 - as long it runs TweakScale 2.4.4 or newer and has a working NF Add'On available!
