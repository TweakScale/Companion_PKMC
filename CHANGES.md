# TweakScale Companion :: Post Kerbin Mining Corporation Add'Ons :: Changes

* 2025-0207: 2.2.1.2 (Lisias) for KSP >= 1.3
	+ Removes `:FOR`, as this thing creates a MM tag no matter `:NEEDS` is satisfied or not.
		- Not exactly needed on this case, but I want to keep things on the clear and prevent people from falling on the same booby trap I felt in.
	+ Closes issue:
		- [#8](https://github.com/TweakScale/Companion_PKMC/issues/8) Remove `:FOR` from patches using both `:FOR` and `:NEEDS` for the same name identifier.	
* 2023-0330: 2.2.1.1 (Lisias) for KSP >= 1.3
	+ Fixes a double-patching problem I created on NFLV due some left-overs I forgot to remove from some files.
		- Thanks to [Tsani](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/183018-tsani/) for the [heads up](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/179030-ksp-130-tweakscale-under-lisias-management-2471-2023-0324/&do=findComment&comment=4267399)! 
* 2023-0318: 2.2.1.0 (Lisias) for KSP >= 1.3
